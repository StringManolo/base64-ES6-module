# base64-ES6-module
You can use it in node, browser, quickjs...  
  
Encode and decode base64.  
Why this module? Because atob/btoa are not available in some enviroments and other modules include a bunch of boilerplate code i don't need.
  
If you can't use import/ES6 module, you can copy and paste the file code and remove the export line.
